Patient A contacts Dr. Drew Dentist complaining about pain in lower right quadrant of his mouth. He mentioned the pain started two weeks ago and has worsened. He noticed sharp, stabbing pain provoked by drinking cold beverages in the past week and lingering pain with biting in the last 2 days. Patient A is able to eat regular food, but is only chewing on the left side. He is taking 400mg ibuprofen every 8 hours for pain. 

Patient A has a history of hypertension and takes Lisinopril 10mg tablet once daily. He is also taking erythromycin 500mg every 6 hours for the infection, and additional ibuprofen for pain as needed. He is allergic to penicillin. 

Dr. Dentist takes Patient Aâ€™s clinical impressions and sends referral to Endodontist for an evaluation of tooth #30 and endodontic therapy #30. Referral included medications prescribed, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment notes, images, and follow up recommendations.
