Dental images such as bitewing x-rays are not expected to be embedded within a Dental Referral composition or Dental Consultation Note composition. The exchange of actual dental images is expected to occur via secure email or some other secure and private exchange pathway in dental referral use cases.  If a narrative describing findings from review of an image is available, it can be conveyed in an Observation resource.
