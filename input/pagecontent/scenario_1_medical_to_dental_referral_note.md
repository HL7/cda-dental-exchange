Patient A is a 30-year-old male who has mild hypertension, Type 1 Diabetes, and has an insulin pump. He sees his primary care physician, Dr. John M at Good Health Clinic, for a routine, annual check-up. Aside from medical concerns, Patient A mentions increasing pain in his left lower jaw and some occasional bleeding from his gums. Dr. John M makes an urgent referral to a dentist for further evaluation and discusses the plan with Patient A, who agrees with the plan. Dr. John M generates a Patient Referral Note that includes data describing the dental related findings. Before Patient A leaves, the referral coordinator at the front desk schedules an appointment for him to see Dr. Drew Dentist for the next day.
