The Dental Findings resource conveys clinically significant observations confirmed or discovered during a dental visit. It reuses data structures ccommonly found in the Condition resource and the Observation resource, and the implementer may choose how to select which data belong in  Dental Findings versus the other resources referenced.

The HL7 community recommends the following practices:
* Keep dental findings that a medical provider would consider clutter in Dental Findings, and not in the Condition resource. (e.g., Active Caries on Tooth #3)
* Keep dental measurements that a medical provider would consider clutter in Dental Findings, and not in the Observartion resource. (e.g., Overjet of 3mm)
