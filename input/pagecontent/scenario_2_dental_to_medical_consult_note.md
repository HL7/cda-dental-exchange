Patient A sees Dr. Drew Dentist on February 16th for an urgent evaluation based on a referral from Dr. John M, his primary care provider. Patient A is a new patient at Dr. Dentist’s office, so a new patient record is created. Dr. Dentist reviews the risk assessment, the Dental Referral Note from Dr. John M, and the rest of the information that was pre-populated in the dental EHR. Dr. Dentist performs an oral evaluation and two PA radiographs. He identifies two areas of concern: patient has a significant, non-restorable caries lesion (decay) on the left lower back molar (tooth #18) with signs of infection, and early signs of decay on the right upper incisor (tooth #7). 

Dr. Dentist recommends an extraction of the left lower molar (tooth #18) and restoration of the right upper lateral incisor (tooth #7) due to a caries lesion (decay). Dr. Dentist explains the importance of using a fluoride toothpaste when brushing twice daily with daily flossing, and of the need for bi-annual dental visits for examination and prophylaxis (cleaning). 

Before Patient A leaves, the receptionist schedules an appointment for the extraction of tooth #18 on February 23rd, another appointment for restoration of tooth #7 on March 3rd, and a follow-up appointment for a complete examination, including radiographs and prophylaxis on March 10th. 

Dr. Dentist reviews Patient A’s current medication list, notes an allergy to penicillin that is a counter-indication for his typical recommendation of amoxicillin, prescribes Erythromycin 500 mg every six hours for the infection and recommends alternating over-the-counter Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen for pain. Also, he generates a Dental Consultation Note back to Dr. John M with a summary of Patient A’s visit including the new prescription, planned procedures, future appointment dates, and patient specific dental goals.
