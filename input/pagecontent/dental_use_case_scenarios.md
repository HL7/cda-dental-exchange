Use cases can bridge understanding between conceptual interpretations and technical implementation of this guide. These use cases were tested at the May 2020 FHIR Connectathon: Dental Summary Exchange Track, and further refined by the project. 

The use cases outlined in this section show the complexity of the information that can be exchanged between a dental and medical system or two dental systems. [These scenarios are available on Confluence](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/ATT/Exchange+Scenarios).  

Fully-formed XML sample files representing the data included in each of these scenarios are published with this implementation guide.

Figure 10 below represents the high-level workflow described across Scenarios 1 (Dental Referral Note) and 2 (Dental Consultation Note).
