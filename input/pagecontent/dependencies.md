This  guide  leverages the [American National Standard/American Dental Association (ANS/ADA) Specification Number 1084; *Reference Core Data Set for Communication among Dental and other Health Information Systems, *2019](https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/55936116/ADA Standard No. 1084_May 2019.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1560955690222&api=v2). It is also informed by the work of the MORE Care (Medical Oral Expanded Care), an initiative of the DentaQuest Partnership to integrate oral health competencies and capabilities into primary care offices while building patient-centered referral networks with local dental providers using health information technology.

This Implementation Guide is based upon the prior work from the US Core and CCDA-on-FHIR Implementation Guides. This Implementation Guide is supported by the Da Vinci initiative which is a private effort to accelerate the adoption of Health Level Seven International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (HL7. FHIR.) as the standard to support and integrate value-based care (VBC) data exchange across communities. As an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide, changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring Payer/Provider Information Exchange (PPIE) workgroup and are incorporated as part of the standard balloting process.
