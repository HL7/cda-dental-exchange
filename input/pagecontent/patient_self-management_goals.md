A Goals Section is represented as a MAY in the referral and consult note, providing specific patient goals separate from instruction. Goals may represent what the patient should do in addition to standard instructions given to the patient. The work group suggests conveying dental goals in the Problem Section of the CCDA. Below are examples of self-management dental goals:

* See dentist/regular dental visits	
* Healthy snacks
* No soda/sugary drinks/energy drinks	
* Brush twice daily
* Less/no junk food/candy	
* Floss daily
* Use fluoride toothpaste	
* Limit caffeine
* Dental treatment for current teeth	
* Tobacco cessation
* Quit/decrease alcohol consumption	
* Seek drug abuse/use treatment
