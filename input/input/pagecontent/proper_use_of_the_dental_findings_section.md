The Dental Findings Section template is intended to convey clinically significant observations confirmed or discovered during a dental visit.  It reuses data structures more commonly found in the Condition resource and the Observation resource, and discretion is left to the implementer for how to select which data belongs in the Dental Findings resource vs the other resources referenced.

The HL7 community recommends the following practices:
* Keep dental findings that a medical provider would consider clutter in the Dental Findings resource, and not in the Condition resource. (e.g., Active Caries on Tooth #3)	
* Keep dental measurements that a medical provider would consider clutter in the Dental Findings resource, and not in the Observartion resource. (e.g., Overjet of 3mm)
