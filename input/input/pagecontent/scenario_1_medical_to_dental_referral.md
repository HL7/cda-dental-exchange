He sees his primary care physician, Dr. Smith at Good Health Clinic, for a routine, annual check-up. Aside from medical concerns, John mentions increasing pain in his left lower jaw and some occasional bleeding from his gums. Dr. Smith makes an urgent referral to a dentist for further evaluation and discusses the plan with John, who agrees with the plan. Dr. Smith generates a CCDA Referral Note that includes data [reference sample file] describing the dental related findings. Before John leaves, the referral coordinator at the front desk schedules an appointment for John to see Dentist B for the next day.
