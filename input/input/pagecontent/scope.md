In September 2019, the Dental Exchange Stakeholder WG was convened to review the data requirements and workflow for this project. The purpose of this workgroup was to develop the necessary complementary CDA templates and FHIR Resources to exchange referral information and consultation results.  Dental specific data concepts called for in the ANSI/ADA 1084 standard (https://confluence.hl7.org/download/attachments/55936116/ADA%20Standard%20No.%201084_May%202019.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1560955690222&api=v2) and the DentaQuest Partnershipâ€™s MORE Care and Oral Health Value-Based Care initiatives.

The work group also referenced value sets set by the Systematized Nomenclature of Dentistry (SNODENT) working group, under SNOMED-CT. SNODENT is an official subset of SNOMED-CT, with the intended purpose to provide standardized terms for describing dental disease, capture clinical detail and patient characteristics, permit analysis of patient care services and outcomes, and to be interoperable with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Electronic Dental Records (EDR). Additionally, SNODENT is mapped to ICD-10-CM to facilitate reporting of diagnoses for billing. SNODENT includes a web-based search browser (https://snodent.ada.org/?_ga=2.134023693.2024077241.1583246507-2071322702.1566919789) where implementors can browse dental related terms and code sets.

As the work group participants were still in a forming stage, an initial task was to validate the ADA 1084 and its assessment to the CDA R2 standard and FHIR R4. The intent was to identify dental data concepts and pose any missing gaps in the conceptual representation of exchanging dental data. Understanding that the ADA established consensus across dental providers of what shared dental concepts could be exchanged, the work group used the ADA 1084 as the authoritative reference for dental data inclusion.

To better understand the dental referral process, representation from the medical and dental   side detailed out a current process flow of sending and receiving a medical to dental and dental to dental information. Identifying the current and future state allowed the work group to better familiarize focus areas and pain points when developing this implementation guide. Figure X below represents a dental referral request from the Military Health System perspective.
