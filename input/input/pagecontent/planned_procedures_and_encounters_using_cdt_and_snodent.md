When populating the Service Request, if appropriate, implementers should use CDT terms to describe the planned encounter. The procedure is encouraged to be from LOINC, SNOMED-CT, CPT-4 , or ICD10 PCS, and similarly the encounter is encouraged to be from a valueset consisting of SNOMED-CT values. However, in both cases, the conformance statement linking these elements to terminologies only have the strength of **SHOULD**. When referring to dental encounters or procedures in the Service Request, a CDT term would be more appropriate and should be used.  Additionally if a procedureis planned, implementers should follow the best practice to include a    SNODENT concept.
